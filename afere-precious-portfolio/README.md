# Problems and solutions

I add problems coming up with ideas for my portfolio, i needed a creative idea for my project, i took a while to think about me as a person and how i would want users and recruiter to get know me more as a person.

I struggled in making my website responsive, since am still about Media query, but when i got a grasp of it, i was able to move forward in my project.
